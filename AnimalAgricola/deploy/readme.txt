There is no AI or networking present. Two players play on one computer.

## Controls

 - Use mouse to select actions.
 - Left click on farm to build or unbuild fences/troughs/buildings.

### Manipulating animals

 - Acquired animals are waiting below your farm for you to place them.
 - Possible animal locations are marked with blue/red circles.
 - Any unplaced animals will run away at the end of your turn.
 
 - Left-click on pasture/building to add one animal of particular type.
 - Right-click on pasture/building to remove one animal.
 - Use double-click to add/remove all available animals.
 - Alternatively, use mouse wheel to add/remove animals (this is the most convenient way - try it).

### Undo/Redo

 - There is no limit - you can undo any number of actions/turns.
 - Undo/redo does not remember exact placements of your animals.
 	- Game will maintain the correct number of animals, but their positions may change.
 	- You will need to reposition your animals manually after redoing an animal-related action.
